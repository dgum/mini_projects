# mini_projects
 
A repo that contains some of the code I've been tinkering with and using to learn DS/ML/AI things. 
Things I've finished up so far:  
- Gradient descent for linear regression from scratch: [notebook](https://github.com/dgum/mini_projects/blob/main/Gradient_Descent_Demo.ipynb)

Things I want to do next:  
- Stochastic Gradient Descent
- Code a CNN from scratch
- Code a Transformer from scratch
